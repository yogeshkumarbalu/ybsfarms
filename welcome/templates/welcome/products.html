                Our Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous. Unlike cow's milk, coconut milk is lactose free so can be used as a milk substitute by those with lactose intolerance. It is a popular choice with vegans and makes a great base for smoothies, milkshakes or as a dairy alternative in baking.
                Coconuts are one of those foods that oscillate between the 'good' food and 'bad' food camps. Coconut milk, especially the lower fat variety, can be used in moderation (1-2 times per week).

Since cooking oil is used in many different ways, eliminating this dangerous cholesterol from your body can help prevent a variety of health complications. Furthermore, not only does peanut oil lack cholesterol, it can actually reduce your current levels of cholesterol due to the presence of plant sterols.

             The humble onion is found in every kitchen, but its curative powers make it an important medicinal plant too. Like garlic, it is a member of the lily family. There can be no doubting the power of the juices contained in onions; anyone who has ever sliced one and shed a tear is only too aware that they hold something special. Quite apart from its medicinal properties the onion is simply delicious. It forms the basis of so many dishes - whether raw, saut√©ed, baked, steamed or boiled, that it would be difficult to imagine the cuisine of any country without it.

             Tapioca, most commonly used in pudding, is a starch made from the root of the cassava plant. It can be purchased as granules, flakes and powders, although it's most commonly available in the form of little round balls. You can make savory and sweet dishes with tapioca, or simply use it as a thickening agent. Naturally low in fat and high in carbohydrates, tapioca can be used in place of arrowroot, cornstarch or flour to thicken sauces and soups.

We dont use machines to get milk from them and we dont process it. Milk directly from the cow and consumed within hours is the healthiest milk we can drink ever. 
                     Decades of scientific research have substantiated the many health benefits associated with milk, including increasing bone health, lowering blood pressure and boosting immunity. When taking into account the numerous health benefits milk and dairy products offer, the inexpensive cost per serving and the amount of nutrients packed in each serving, milk and milk products are an essential part of a healthy diet. There is no other single food or beverage that provides the same irreplaceable package of nutrients/components, with its unique interactions, as provided by milk.
